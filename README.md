# DigitClassifier
Model created and trained using Tensorflow. The dataset used is the MNIST handwritten digits dataset. The GUI was created using tkinter. User is able to “handwrite” a digit and then the model will return its best guess at which digit it is. Since this is a categorical problem, I decided to use a sigmoid activation function and the sparse categorical cross entropy loss function. Achieved an accuracy of 99.9% among the test data.
